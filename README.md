Multi linear regression (python)

Here i have fitted a multiple linear regression model for the WHO life expectancy data set .The model is particularly fitted for finding out the life expectancy of  people in the developing countries.This has done with the help of pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, and seaborn packages in python.An detailed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) followed by model fitting and model evaluation(with the help of  diagnostic plots ) has done in detail.
